In this tutorial, you will learn how how to use the Sneer cloud. It's pretty simple but I assume you are familiar with [Reactive Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming). Here is a nice introduction on the subject: [Functional Reactive Programming on Android With RxJava](http://mttkay.github.io/blog/2013/08/25/functional-reactive-programming-on-android-with-rxjava/). You should definitely give it a try.

Getting Started
---------------
*As it's a multiplayer game you'll need two emulators (or devices) to test the app.*

Ok, clone this project using git, import it into your Android Development Toolkit workspace and follow the steps below.

  - Create a libs folder in the root folder of your project.
  
  - Download the latest snapi-no-deps.jar from [here](#) and add it to the libs folder.

  - Create two emulators

  - Run the project on both emulators and play with it for a little :)
   
  
Now open the file RockPaperScissorsActivity.java and take a few minutes to understand the code until you feel confortable with it.

...

To access the cloud:

```JAVA
Cloud cloud = new Cloud();
```
To challenge a friend for a match:
```JAVA
cloud.pub...
```
To listen to challenges from friends:
```JAVA
cloud.subâ€¦
```
etc
