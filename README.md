In this tutorial, we are going to add the missing code to use the Sneer cloud.

  - Clone this project using git and import it into the Android Development Toolkit.

  - Create a libs folder in the root folder of your project. Download the latest snapi-no-deps.jar from [here](#) and add it to the libs folder.

  - Run the project. The app itself will tell you what to do to make it work, so you can stop reading here and just use the app. :)
